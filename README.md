# seminf

Semi-infinite matter in the Thomas-Fermi approximation

This code requires O<sub>2</sub>scl (http://web.utk.edu/~asteine1/o2scl), 
GSL (http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl), Boost (http://www.boost.org), 
and HDF5 (https://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/).

The code appears to work marginally for Skyrme model NRAPR and RMF
model RAPR, but still needs quite a bit of work.
